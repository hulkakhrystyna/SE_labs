    <h1>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is that main way that the ‘front end’ web is programmed ie, that dynamic and user-interactive features are implemented (eg. complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus). Truly dynamic features such as personalisation rely on the communication between the frontend (browser) and backend (server). . ‘Backend’ programming languages used extensively for the web include PHP, Java and Python.</p>
    <p>Javascript is commonly seen as a progaramming langauge for the front-end, ie. the code is executed in the browser. However, this module focuses on using JavaScript for both front-end (web page or client-side) and back-end (server-side) programming - a combination that is becoming increasingly common.</p>
