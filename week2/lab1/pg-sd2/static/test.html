    <h1>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is that main way that the ‘front end’ web is programmed ie, that dynamic and user-interactive features are implemented (eg. complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus). Truly dynamic features such as personalisation rely on the communication between the frontend (browser) and backend (server). . ‘Backend’ programming languages used extensively for the web include PHP, Java and Python.</p>
